# Fluid Tweets

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start the Fluid server and run the app

In the Command Prompt, run the following command to start the Fluid service. Note that tinylicious is the name of the Fluid service that runs on localhost.

`npx tinylicious`

Open a new Command Prompt and navigate to the root of the project; for example, C:/My Fluid Projects/fluid-react-tutorial. Start the application server with the following command. The application opens in your browser. This may take a few minutes.

`npm run start`

Paste the URL of the application into the address bar of another tab or even another browser to have more than one client open at a time. Pre

## Resources

I've been following [this Fluid Framework guide](https://fluidframework.com/docs/recipes/react/) to set-up the Fluid experience.
